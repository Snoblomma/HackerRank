Consider an array of integers, *A* = *a0, a1, a2, ... a(n-1)*. We define the absolute difference between two elements, *ai* and *aj* (where *i!=j*), to be the absolute value of *ai-aj*.

Given an array of *n* integers, find and print the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.

### Input Format

The first line contains a single integer denoting *n* (the number of integers). 

The second line contains *n* space-separated integers describing the respective values of *a0, a1, a2, ... a(n-1)*.

### Constraints
* 2 <= *n* <= 10^5
* -10^9 <= *ai* <= 10^9

### Output Format

Print the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.

### Sample Input
```
