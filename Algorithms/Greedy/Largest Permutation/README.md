You are given an array of *N* integers which is a permutation of the first *N* natural numbers. You can swap any two elements of the array. You can make at most *K* swaps. What is the largest permutation, in numerical order, you can make?

###Input Format 
The first line of the input contains two integers, *N* and *K*, the size of the input array and the maximum swaps you can make, respectively. The second line of the input contains a permutation of the first *N* natural numbers.

###Output Format 
Print the lexicographically largest permutation you can make with **at most** *K* swaps.

###Constraints 
* 1 ≤ *N* ≤ 10^5
* 1 ≤ *K* ≤ 10^9
