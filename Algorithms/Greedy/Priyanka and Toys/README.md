Little Priyanka visited a kids' shop. There are *N* toys and their weight is represented by an array *W* = [*w1, w2,..., wN*]. Each toy costs 1 unit, and if she buys a toy with weight *w'*, then she can get all other toys whose weight lies between *[w`*, *w` + 4]* (both inclusive) free of cost.

###Input Format

The first line contains an integer *N* i.e. number of toys.
Next line will contain *N* integers, *w1, w2,..., wN*, representing the weight array.

###Output Format

Minimum units with which Priyanka could buy all of toys.

###Constraints

* 1 ≤ *N* ≤ 10^5

* 0 ≤ *wi* ≤ 10^4, where *i* ∈ [1, *N*]
