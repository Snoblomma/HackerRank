Alice has a binary string, *B*, of length *n*. She thinks a binary string is beautiful if and only if it doesn't contain the substring "010".

In one step, Alice can change a 0 to a 1 (or vice-versa). Count and print the minimum number of steps needed to make Alice see the string as beautiful.

###Input Format

The first line contains an integer, *n* (the length of binary string *B*). 
The second line contains a single binary string, *B*, of length *n*.

###Constraints

* 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100
* Each character in *B* Є {0,1}.

###Output Format

Print the minimum number of steps needed to make the string beautiful.
