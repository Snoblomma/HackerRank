Dan is playing a video game in which his character competes in a hurdle race by jumping over *n* hurdles with heights *h0, h1, ... hn-1*. He can initially jump a maximum height of *k* units, but he has an unlimited supply of magic beverages that help him jump higher! Each time Dan drinks a magic beverage, the maximum height he can jump during the race increases by 1 unit.

Given *n*, *k*, and the heights of all the hurdles, find and print the *minimum* number of magic beverages Dan must drink to complete the race.

###Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of *n* (the number of hurdles) and *k* (the maximum height he can jump without consuming any beverages). 
The second line contains *n* space-separated integers describing the respective values of *h0, h1,...hn-1*.

###Constraints

* 1 ≤ *n,k* ≤ 100
* 1 ≤ *hi* ≤ 100

###Output Format

Print an integer denoting the *minimum* number of magic beverages Dan must drink to complete the hurdle race.
