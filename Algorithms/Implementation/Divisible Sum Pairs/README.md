You are given an array of *n* integers, *a0, a1, ... a(n-1)* and a positive integer, *k*. Find and print the number of *(i,j)* pairs where *i<j* and *ai + aj* is evenly divisible by *k*.

### Input Format

The first line contains 2 space-separated integers, *n* and *k*, respectively. 
The second line contains *n* space-separated integers describing the respective values of *a0, a1, ... a(n-1)*.

### Constraints

* 2 <= n <= 100
* 1 <= k <= 100
* 1 <= aj <= 100

### Output Format

Print the number of *(i, j)* pairs where *i < j* and *ai + aj* is evenly divisible by *k*.
