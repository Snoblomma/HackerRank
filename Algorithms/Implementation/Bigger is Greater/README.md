Given a word *w*, rearrange the letters of *w* to construct another word *s* in such a way that *s* is lexicographically greater than *w*. In case of multiple possible answers, find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

**Input Format**

The first line of input contains *t*, the number of test cases. Each of the next *t* lines contains *w*.

**Constraints**

* 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5

* 1 ≤ |w| ≤ 100

* *w* will contain only lower-case English letters and its length will not exceed 100.

**Output Format**

For each testcase, output a string lexicographically bigger than *w* in a separate line. In case of multiple possible answers, print the lexicographically smallest one, and if no answer exists, print no answer.
