Regular expressions (*regexp*) help us match or search for patterns in strings. In this problem, you will be given a username. Your task is to check whether that username is valid. A valid username will have the following properties:

1. The username can contain alphanumeric characters and/or underscores(_).
2. The username must start with an alphabetic character.
3. 8 ≤ |Username| ≤ 30.

To simplify your task, we have provided a portion of the code in the editor. You just need to write down the regex pattern which will be used to validate the username input.

###Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer *N*, representing the number of testcases. Each of the next *N* lines contains a string that represents a username.

###Constraints

* The username consists of any printable characters.

* 1 ≤ *N* ≤ 100

###Output Format

For each username, output Valid if the username is valid; otherwise, output Invalid.
