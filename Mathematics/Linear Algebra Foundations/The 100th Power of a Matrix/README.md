Given the following matrix *A*:
```
            [1   1   0 ]
      A =   [0   1   0 ]
            [0   0   1 ]
```
We compute that

A100 =
```
    [A B 0]
    [0 C 0]
    [0 D E]
```

In the text box below, enter the values of the integers *A*, *B*, *C*, *D*, *E* each in a new line. Do not leave any extra leading or trailing spaces.
