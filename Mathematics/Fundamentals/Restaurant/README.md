Martha is interviewing at Subway. One of the rounds of the interview requires her to cut a bread of size *l*x*b* into smaller identical pieces such that each piece is a square having maximum possible side length with no left over piece of bread.

### Input format 
The first line contains an integer *T*. *T* lines follow. Each line contains two space separated integers *l* and *b* which denote length and breadth of the bread.

### Output format

*T* lines, each containing an integer that denotes the number of squares of maximum size, when the bread is cut as per the given condition.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
* 1 ≤ l, b ≤ 1000

### Sample Input
```
2
2 2
6 9
```
### Sample Output
```
1
6
```
### Explanation

The 1st testcase has a bread whose original dimensions are 2 x 2, the bread is uncut and is a square. Hence the answer is 1. 

The 2nd testcase has a bread of size 6 x 9. We can cut it into 54 squares of size 1 x 1, 0 of size 2 x 2, 6 of size 3 x 3, 0 of size 4 x 4, 0 of size 5 x 5 and 0 of size 6 x 6. The number of squares of maximum size that can be cut is 6.
